The clj-record example from Clojure in Action, chapter 9

## Usage

make a mysql database using sql/damages.sql

  lein deps
  lein swank

from emacs 

  M-x slime connect

then load 

  src/damages/core.clj 

and compile it.

The sexps in the comment in core.clj can now be executed one by one, demonstrating chapter 9 in "Clojure in Action" by Amit Rathore

To me, it was unclear where the different pieces of code from the book should be defined to work together. I hope this barebones example will clear things up for other readers of the book.
