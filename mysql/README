# mysql & clj-record & compojure & json

Providing a working example based on chapter 9.1 in Clojure in Action by Amit Rathore.

A compojure based front end has been added to this example to demonstrate basic model/view/controller functionality

## Usage

First, navigate to src/chapter09 and execute

    sudo mysql < damages.sql

to create the database schema used in the example.

Use your favorite way to start up clojure.

    src/chapter09/usage.clj 

to follow the example in chapter 9.1 or

    src/chapter09/web.clj 

to start up a web-server to offer a web-based gui to interact with the database
